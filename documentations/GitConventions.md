# Git Conventions

## Branch Naming Convention

Every branch must start conform with the following conventions:
 - *branch_type/**trello_card_id**_branch_functionality_description*
- *branch_type/branch_functionality_description*
Branches should use Trello card id whenever they are available. If no card is available, a card should be created, unless, **and this unless should be seldomly applied**, the alteration is small, such as a typo on a documentation or a small refactor (*ex:* renaming a variable).

### Branch Types

Every branch must be one of the following types:
 - feat
 - fix
 - refactor
 - doc
 - config

## Commit Messages Rules

Every branch  must start with either:
 - Trello history ID inside brackets
    - *Ex*: **[000001]** Done some work
  - Refactor
      - Ex: **Refactor**  - fix small typo
  - Merge
      - Ex **Merge** 
 - Squashed commit of the following: commit history (auto generated by tortoise git)
     - Squashed commit of the following: 
    
# GitHooks

These rules must be enforced by githooks in a future revision

# Research

It's being investigated the benefits of squash merges over regular merges.
To investigate this, both **master** and **master_merged_with_squash_commits** are being maintained. The first is used regular merges that keep all commit history while the second one is used squash merges. Long term benefits of both implementations should be considered.
